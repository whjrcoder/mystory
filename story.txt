story 
The hare is very confident of winning, so it stops during the race and falls asleep. The tortoise continues to move very slowly but without stopping and finally it wins the race. 
The moral lesson of the story is that you can be more successful by doing things slowly and steadily than by acting quickly and carelessly.


Aesop's famous fable tells the story of a tortoise who, ridiculed by the hare for being slow, challenges it to a race.
